# bookCase

bookCase is an basic application that allows users to interact with other users and their book recommendations. Guests can view a list of books added by users, but users are able to add in a book and mark whether it has a movie adaptation or not. On the book's page, users can see who added the book, have the option of changing if the book has an adaptation, leaving a review for the book, and deleting the book if they added it.
